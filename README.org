* freddiaN's CPMA 1.50 Server netinstall script

To use this script, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freddiaN/cpmnetinstall/master/setup.sh
bash setup.sh
#+END_SRC

This script will ask for some needed information first, then it will download a barebones server and edit the start and config files according to the previously given information.

** TODOs
**** TODO add a way to update the maps on the server (Arctic's bash script and/or an offcial script by myT)
**** TODO maybe even a rewrite in something that isn't bash? :D
**** TODO add support [[https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl][doctl]] and [[https://github.com/JamesClonk/vultr][this vultr cli]] for automatic deployment of servers
