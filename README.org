* freddiaN's CPMA Server netinstall script

To use this script, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freddiaN/cpmnetinstall/master/setup.sh
bash setup.sh
#+END_SRC

This script will ask for some needed information first, then it will download all the parts needed for a barebones server (excluding the pak0.pk3) and change the configs based on the previously fed information. In the future, it will also download a set of custom maps based on which gamemodes the server is supposed to run.

** TODOs
**** TODO if possible, use the CNQ3 map server to update maps instead of arctic's SFTP server
