* freddiaN's CPMA Server netinstall script

To use this script, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://gitlab.com/freddiaN/cpmnetinstall/raw/master/setup.sh
bash setup.sh
#+END_SRC

This script will ask for some needed information first, then it will download all the parts needed for a barebones server (excluding the pak0.pk3) and change the configs based on the previously fed information. In the future, it will also download a set of custom maps based on which gamemodes the server is supposed to run.

** TODOs
**** TODO add a way to update the maps on the server (Arctic's bash script and/or an offcial script by myT)
**** TODO maybe even a rewrite in something that isn't bash? :D
**** TODO add support [[https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl][doctl]], [[https://github.com/linode/linode-cli][linode-cli]] and [[https://github.com/JamesClonk/vultr][this vultr cli]] for automatic deployment of servers
