* freddiaN's CPMA 1.50 Server netinstall script
  
To use this script, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freddiaN/cpmnetinstall/master/setup.sh
bash setup.sh
#+END_SRC

This script will ask for some needed information first, then it will download a barebones server and edit the start and config files according to the previously given information.

** TODOs
**** TODO ask for the installation path in the beginning, so it isn't forced into $HOME
**** TODO either have the MOTD be editable from the installscript or have a generic one that is good enough :>
